# Notes

A list of my notes to talk about in the future

## Items

- Configure backup file browser to show which ones are kept for which "grandfather phase"
- Finish Integrations settings page so those configs can be edited
- Per-channel notification routing: Allow selecting different destinations per event type (e.g., infra alerts to email, Telegram stuff to DM) instead of all-or-nothing radio buttons
