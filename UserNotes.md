# Notes

A list of my notes to talk about in the future

## Items

- lets go through our razor pages and identify large files that probably should be broken up into smaller reusable components

## Open Source Release - Remaining Tasks (Deferred)

After devcontainer setup is complete, revisit these:

### Documentation

- Add README badges (license, build status, etc.)

### GitHub Templates

- Add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ for bug reports and feature requests
- Add .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
- Consider .github/workflows/ for CI/CD (Docker image publishing to GHCR)
