# Notes

A list of my notes to talk about in the future

## Items

- logging settings not working on the fly.  my guess is there is an issue with how ILogger works if you want to change the log level while the app is running without a restart
- Telegram Bot doesnt gracefully handle an internet outage and requires app reboot if it loses connection
