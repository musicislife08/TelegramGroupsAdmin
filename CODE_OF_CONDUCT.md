# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

This project is about building great software. What matters here is your code, your ideas, and your contributions to this project.

Your personal beliefs, identity, politics, or anything else unrelated to this project don't belong in project spaces. If it's not about TelegramGroupsAdmin, it's off-topic.

## Expected Behavior

- **Focus on the project** - Keep discussions technical and relevant
- **Be respectful** - Critique code and ideas, not people
- **Be constructive** - Offer solutions, not just complaints
- **Be helpful** - Help newcomers learn and contribute

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks, harassment, or trolling
- Injecting unrelated political, social, or religious topics
- Publishing private information without consent
- Spam or off-topic discussions
- Any behavior that disrupts productive technical work

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported to <security@weekenders.us>. Maintainers will review and take appropriate action (warning, temporary ban, permanent ban).

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, and any official communication channels.

**Bottom line:** Contribute good code. Stay on topic. Treat others with basic respect. That's all we ask.
